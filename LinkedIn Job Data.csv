Save The Children,3 weeks ago,<25,Associate,Hospitality,"Waliku MEAL & Data Science Consultant LEARNING NEVER STOPS - (210001UH)  SCOPE OF WORK       Waliku is an innovation project of Save the Children implemented on a pilot scale in Sumba Barat, Indonesia since 2018. Waliku addresses challenges of school-communities in low resource contexts to recognize and act on critical student absences, illnesses and concerns in a timely manner. It digitizes and simplifies daily tasks of schools – to manage the school population, communicate with parents/guardians, link with referral services, and report to school districts.  Waliku’s vision is to ensure every child meets their right to education and well-being. After two years of pilot, Waliku is transitioning its operating model from a donor-funded project to a Save the Children social venture. It will address the needs of its customers - governments and development partners – with products and services that facilitate children’s access to education, as well as health and welfare services.  COVID-19-related school closures have caused significant disruption to the education of all children, particularly those marginalized. As schools reopen, it is crucial to ensure that all children return without delay. Schools need tools like Waliku to know they have been effective in bringing students back and respond to those who have not returned. In order to be accessible to many schools, Waliku is diversifying its solution and scaling, initially in Kabupaten Sumba Barat and Bandung, followed by other locations in Eastern Indonesia and West Java.  Through this paradigm shift in Waliku’s operating model, and scaling our solution in Sumba Barat and introducing it in Bandung, Save the Children Indonesia seeks a Waliku Monitoring, Evaluation, Accounting and Learning (MEAL) Data Analyst for managing Waliku data for both districts.  S/he will help the Waliku Coordinator with developing tools for school mapping exercises, formative assessments, and data collection, as well as support MEAL plan development, Waliku Dashboard and tools development for district and community stakeholders. S/he will adhere to child safeguarding and data privacy policies of Waliku, Save the Children and Government of Indonesia. A MEAL Data Analyst will support the Waliku Global Team’s efforts with making Waliku a more customizable solution and in digitally linking schools with other service providers in the community. The role of this person will be to contribute to the upgrades in the database, maintain a district education dashboard, and develop tools and dashboards that allow links between schools, clinics and child welfare providers. Additionally, this person will develop a dashboard for visualizing absence information for schools that use a simpler solution called Waliku Remote.

Gojek,1 week ago,>200,Associate,"Computer Software,Internet,Financial Services","About The Role  We'll cut to the chase and get to what makes this role exciting. Firstly, it’s a senior analyst role that is highly collaborative (think of it like a data consultant). Secondly, your work will directly impact the scope and growth of GoPay - Indonesia's largest e-wallet service. More specifically, you'll oversee GoPay's data products, which consist of automated data dashboards, reports, alerts, and simulation tools. Working closely with the Product and Business teams, you'll help address and resolve the platform's critical issues and guide the direction for its next features. In our opinion, the coolest part of this role is your ability to own the future of this product, ensure its quality and longevity, and see the results of your efforts in people's everyday lives.        Our team likes to see ourselves as what blood is to the brain - constantly supplying the brain with oxygen so it can function properly. Our super team of 6 BI analysts supplies data and insights that fuel GoPay's innovations and evolutions. How does one achieve this, you may ask? Through our data products (automated dashboards, reports, alerts, and simulation tools) and continuous collaboration with the folks in the business and product teams. We are in charge of creating foundational customer segmentations, designing automation processes for campaign tracking, and providing regular reports to the leadership team. Anything data-related within growth, digital inclusion, or risk and fraud for GoPay is what our team is concerned about✌🏽  But despite how hardworking we may seem, we do know how to have fun, too. As a matter of fact, we select someone from the team to become our ‘Minister of Entertainment’ each month. The honorary person then will decide what fun activities we can do together😋. This is especially an important tradition for us with WFH becoming more normalized. While we do miss our monthly outings/dinners, thank goodness for the invention of Slack and Zoom calls that keep us feeling close.    Gojek is a Super App. It’s one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, and dozen other products. It is Indonesia’s first and only decacorn. It's also the only Southeast Asian startup to be part of Fortune's list of 'Companies That Changed The World.'  To create and scale positive socio-economic impact for our customers, driver-partners, business and MSMEs.  As of 2018, Gojek processed more than $9 billion annualised gross transaction value across all markets where it operates - in Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia.

Gojek,1 week ago,>200,Associate,"Computer Software,Internet,Financial Services","About The Role  We'll cut to the chase and get to what makes this role exciting. Firstly, it’s a senior analyst role that is highly collaborative (think of it like a data consultant). Secondly, your work will directly impact the scope and growth of GoPay - Indonesia's largest e-wallet service. More specifically, you'll oversee GoPay's data products, which consist of automated data dashboards, reports, alerts, and simulation tools. Working closely with the Product and Business teams, you'll help address and resolve the platform's critical issues and guide the direction for its next features. In our opinion, the coolest part of this role is your ability to own the future of this product, ensure its quality and longevity, and see the results of your efforts in people's everyday lives.        Our team likes to see ourselves as what blood is to the brain - constantly supplying the brain with oxygen so it can function properly. Our super team of 6 BI analysts supplies data and insights that fuel GoPay's innovations and evolutions. How does one achieve this, you may ask? Through our data products (automated dashboards, reports, alerts, and simulation tools) and continuous collaboration with the folks in the business and product teams. We are in charge of creating foundational customer segmentations, designing automation processes for campaign tracking, and providing regular reports to the leadership team. Anything data-related within growth, digital inclusion, or risk and fraud for GoPay is what our team is concerned about✌🏽  But despite how hardworking we may seem, we do know how to have fun, too. As a matter of fact, we select someone from the team to become our ‘Minister of Entertainment’ each month. The honorary person then will decide what fun activities we can do together😋. This is especially an important tradition for us with WFH becoming more normalized. While we do miss our monthly outings/dinners, thank goodness for the invention of Slack and Zoom calls that keep us feeling close.    Gojek is a Super App. It’s one app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, and dozen other products. It is Indonesia’s first and only decacorn.
